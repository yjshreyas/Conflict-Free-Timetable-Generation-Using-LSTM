# ðŸ§  Conflict-Free Timetable Generation Using LSTM

### ðŸ“… Automated Timetable Scheduler using Deep Learning (PyTorch)

This project implements a **timetable generation system** that automatically schedules **lectures, labs, and tutorials** for multiple sections, teachers, and classrooms using a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** model.  

It ensures that **no two teachers, classrooms, or batches conflict**, while dynamically learning from existing schedule data to make smarter teacher assignments.
